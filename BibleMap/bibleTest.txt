Book 01	Genesis
001 001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
001 002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
001 003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
001 004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
001 005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
001 006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
001 007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
001 008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
Book 60	1 Peter
001 001 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
001 002 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
001 003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
001 004 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
001 005 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
001 006 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
001 007 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
001 008 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
001 009 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
